# Materials & Archival Considerations

Every element in this project has been carefully selected for its **archival stability**, **longevity**, and **craftsmanship**. From printing inks to paper fibers, from binding thread to storage enclosure, every decision reflects a commitment to permanence and artistic integrity.

## Printing

- **Printer:** Epson SureColor P700  
  *(10-color pigment-based archival printer with carbon-based black inks)*  
- **Inks:** Epson UltraChrome Pro10   
  *(Tested for over 400 years of permanence under controlled conditions)*  
- **Print Longevity:** [Wilhelm Imaging Research – Epson P700 Report](https://www.wilhelm-research.com/epson/WIR_Epson_SureColor_P700_and_P900_Printers_2021_07_23.pdf)

## Paper

- **Printed Pages:** [Hahnemühle Photo Rag 188 gsm] (https://www.hahnemuehle.ca/photo-rag/) 
  *(100% cotton, acid-free, lignin-free, ISO 9706 certified)*  
- **OBAs (Optical Brightening Agents):** None  
  *(UV light cause degradation of many material over time, for long term purposes, it should be avoided)*
   [Just have a look at the second column here compared to the first one](http://www.wilhelm-research.com/Canson/WIR_Canson_Fine_Art_and_Photo_Papers_Final_Report_2020-06-01.pdf)  
- **Standard Compliance:** [ISO 9706 – Archival Paper Standard](https://cdn.standards.iteh.ai/samples/17562/34a23f9c75e44bc0a5b582d3f3608d35/ISO-9706-1994.pdf)

## Interleaving Sheets

- **Material:** Kozo 30 gsm (Japanese mulberry paper)  
  *(Extremely thin, strong, acid-free, made from renewable fibers)*  
- **Purpose:** Prevents abrasion between facing prints without altering visual balance  
- **Reference:** [Japanese Paper Place – Kozo](https://www.japanesepaperplace.com/haini-kozo-37-5g-custom-10m/)

## Color Management & ICC Profiling

- **Spectrophotometer:** X-Rite i1 Pro 2  
  *(Used for profiling screen and paper/printer combinations)*  
  [X-Rite i1 Pro 2](https://www.xrite.com/categories/calibration-profiling/i1photo-pro-2)

- **Gamut Analysis Tools:**  
  - [ColorThink Pro](https://www.chromix.com/colorthink/#overview)  
  - [GamutVision (free)](http://www.gamutvision.com/modules.php?name=Download)

## Black & White Printing

- **ICC Profile Creation:**  
  - [ABW Profile Maker (GitHub)](https://github.com/doug3236/ABWProfilePatches)  
  - [QuadTone RIP](http://www.quadtonerip.com/)

- **Purpose:** To achieve near-neutral and quasi perfect linear grayscale tones with minimal color ink usage.

## Binding & Book Structure

### Thread & Assembly

- **Thread:** Linen or waxed cotton thread  
  *(Traditional bookbinding material known for flexibility and strength)*

- **Adhesives:** Only archival, acid-free adhesives such as wheat starch paste were used

---

### Covers

- **Outer Material:** Vegetable-tanned leather  
  *(Free from synthetic chemicals, ages gracefully, and safe for long-term contact with paper)*

- **Pigmentation:** Natural pigments used to color the leather  
  *(Chosen for their stability and resistance to chemical degradation or fading over time)*  

- **Interior Lining:** Archival cotton canvas  
  *(Soft, breathable, and compatible with leather. The lining is both hand-sewn and adhered using wheat starch paste to ensure strength and long-term structural integrity while maintaining full archival reversibility.)*

- **Book Wrap:** 100% natural cotton cloth  
  *(Used to gently wrap the book inside the clamshell box, offering additional protection from dust and light. Unbleached and untreated to ensure archival compatibility.)*

---

### Custom Tooling

- **Maple or metal Stamp:** CNC made tool created for imprinting the **book title**, **year**, and a **unique design motif** on the front cover + a hand punched edition number

- **Purpose:** Enhances uniqueness and visual identity of each copy while maintaining minimalism

## Clamshell Archival Box

- **Construction:** [Handmade using 100% cotton archival boards and acid-free adhesives](https://www.peterboromatboards.com/product-museum.php)

- **Features:**

  - Envelope containing a material summary sheet (see below) and a few spare interleave sheets

---

## Included Materials Summary (Inside Box)

- **Printed on:** Hahnemühle Photo Rag 188 gsm (same as book pages)
- **Contents:** One-page summary of materials and methods used in the book's creation
- **Purpose:** Offers quick archival insight for collectors, curators, and preservation specialists

---

## Environmental & Ethical Considerations

- All materials were selected with environmental sustainability in mind  
- No plastic-based coatings or synthetic leathers were used  
- Wherever possible, natural, reversible, or biodegradable materials were preferred
