        <h2>Fine Art Photography Book</h2>

        <p>This page contains the digital reference edition of <em>Rêveries</em>, a fine art photography book, and an overview of my workflow.</p>

        <h2>The 35,000-Foot Overview</h2>
        <p>This is a high-level summary of my workflow, covering exposure, RAW development, printing, and archival details. Links are provided for further exploration.</p>

        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>From capture to print to your eyes, I do my utmost to ensure that every photon counts, that my prints reveal scenes where light comes alive and awakens deep emotion. 
        This project draws on all my knowledge and expertise. Art, technique, and craftsmanship converge in perfect synergy, in the pursuit of excellence and permanence.</p>

        <p>This project was born out of the incredible stability of carbon pigment inks. Over 400 years of permanence was all it took to unite everything around this phenomenal characteristic. 
        Hence, the idea of a book, its covers, and its archival box, made of noble and archival materials, hand-crafted with great care—a messenger of time itself.</p>

        <h2>Exposure</h2>
        <p>ETTR (Expose To The Right) maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and dynamic range.</p>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposing_to_the_right">Learn more about ETTR</a></p>

        <h2>RAW Development & Conversion</h2>
        <p>Scene-referred development preserves the integrity and authenticity of captured sensor data. A correction LUT made from a ColorChecker shot ensures color and luminance accuracy 
        to an even greater level (ΔE00 &lt; 2). The actual workflow is a bit complex, but the results are worth it—akin to Ansel Adams' method of exposing for perfect blacks.</p>

        <h2>Printing</h2>
        <p>Just as my RAW development process is meticulously calibrated, my printing process is equally refined. My printing follows industry best practices. 
        I started by finding the best possible printer, inks, and paper for this project.</p>

        <h2>Paper Selection & ICC Profiling</h2>
        <p>I use an i1 Pro 2 spectrophotometer for all my color management work.</p>

        <h2>Why Image Dependent Gamut Mapping?</h2>
        <p>Flowers often exhibit extreme saturation levels beyond most display and print gamuts. Default gamut mapping methods can cause color compression or hue shifts. 
        <strong>Image Dependent Gamut Mapping</strong> selectively maps colors while preserving their natural relationships.</p>

        <h2>Black & White Printing</h2>
        <p>Most printers are RGB-based. Even with B&W modes, using RGB images (R=G=B) yields the best results. I create custom B&W ICC profiles for optimal neutrality.</p>

        <h2>Print Longevity – Epson SureColor P700</h2>
        <p>I chose the Epson SureColor P700 for its carbon-based pigment black inks and their extraordinary longevity. B&W prints can last over 400 years under proper conditions.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>A print isn’t just ink on paper; it’s the culmination of a process, an intention, and an experience.</p>
